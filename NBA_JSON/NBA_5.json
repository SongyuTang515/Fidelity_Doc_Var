A head coach may trigger instant replay review of certain events subject to the terms \nand conditions set forth in this rule.  Instant replay review triggered pursuant to this rule shall be \nreferred to as a “Coach’s Challenge” (or “Challenge” for short).\nb. Each team is entitled to one Challenge throughout the entire game (regardless of \nwhether the Challenge is successful). \nc. A team may utilize a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of only the following \nthree events: (1) a called personal foul charged to its own team, (2) a called out-of-bounds \nviolation, or (3) a called goaltending or basket interference violation; provided that, in the last \ntwo minutes of the fourth period and last two minutes of any overtime, a team is no longer \nable to utilize a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of a called out-of-bounds violation, \nor called goaltending or basket interference violation, as review of these events during these \nperiods will be exclusively triggered by the on-court game officials. \nNOTE: Notwithstanding the above, the Official NBA (National Basketball Association) Playing Rules have been \nmodified for the 2021-22 NBA (National Basketball Association) season (on a one-year trial basis) to (i) eliminate referee-initiated \ninstant replay review of out-of-bounds violations during the last two minutes of the fourth period \nand the last two minutes of any overtime period; and (ii) extend the Coach’s Challenge so teams \nmay trigger replay review of out-of-bounds violations throughout the entire game. Accordingly, \na Coach’s Challenge is the only mechanism to trigger replay review of out-of-bounds violations \nat any point during the game.\nd. Any called foul, violation, or other decision by the game officials not listed in Section \nI-c above, or any non-call, is not a challengeable event.  For clarity, instant replay review of the \nfollowing events, among others, may not be triggered by a Challenge: (1) a called personal foul \ncharged to the opposing team, (2) continuation—e.g., whether a defensive foul occurred prior \nto the offensive player beginning his shooting motion, (3) a Technical Foul or Flagrant Foul, \nand (4) violations such as traveling, carrying, double dribble, or an offensive or defensive three-\nseconds.  As set forth in Section II-b(3) below, any aspect related to continuation constitutes a \nreviewable matter when a called foul is properly challenged, but continuation is not by itself an \nindependent challengeable event.",
    "58": "- 58 -Section II—Procedure to Initiate the Challenge\na. To initiate a Challenge, the challenging team must take the following steps in sequence:  \n(1) The challenging team must call a legal timeout immediately after the call in \nquestion (unless a mandatory timeout or timeout called by the opposing team is \nalready underway);\n(2)  The challenging team’s head coach must simultaneously signal for a Challenge \nby utilizing the instant replay signal (i.e., twirling an index finger) toward the game \nofficial(s) during the same interaction with the game official(s) in which the timeout \nwas called or, if the timeout was called by a player on the challenging team, the \nchallenging team’s head coach must simultaneously signal for the Challenge by \nutilizing the instant replay signal toward the game officials as the game official is \nnotifying the scorekeeper of the timeout; and\n(3) During the same interaction with the game official(s) in which the challenging \nteam’s head coach signaled for the Challenge, the challenging team’s head coach must \nnotify the game official(s) of the specific event that the team is challenging.\nFor purposes of this rule only, “immediately” shall mean that a timeout is called prior to \nthe ball being given to the thrower-in, the ball being given to the free throw shooter, or \nthe ball being tossed on a jump ball, whichever is applicable (unless a mandatory timeout \nor timeout called by the opposing team is already underway).  \nb. To initiate a Challenge of an event that immediately preceded a mandatory timeout or \ntimeout called by the opposing team, no later than 30 seconds from the start of the timeout (as \nmeasured by the timeout clock), the challenging team’s head coach must take the following steps \nin sequence:  \n(1) Signal for a Challenge by utilizing the instant replay signal toward the game \nofficials; and \n(2) During the same interaction with the game official(s) in which the challenging \nteam’s head coach signaled for the Challenge, the challenging team’s head coach must \nnotify the game official(s) of the specific event that the team is challenging.\nc. In the event the game officials conference to determine the call on the floor (and, as a \nresult, the final ruling on the play is unknown for a period of time), the window of time within \nwhich a team must immediately challenge the call starts after the officials notify the negatively \naffected team of the final ruling on the play. The negatively affected team’s window to challenge \nthe final ruling on the play ends when the ball is given to the inbounder or free throw shooter, \njump-ball is tossed, or 30 seconds after the team has been notified of the final ruling on the play in \nthe event that a mandatory timeout or timeout by the opposing team has been called (whichever \nis applicable).\nd. A team loses its opportunity to challenge the prior call if it is called for a delay-of-game \nafter the call in question but prior to calling timeout and simultaneously signaling for a Challenge.\ne. Once instant replay review is triggered by a valid Challenge, the official will notify \nthe official scorer of the Challenge. The official scorer shall immediately record the Challenge \nand, once the instant replay review process is complete, the outcome of the Challenge (including \nwhether the Challenge resulted in a loss of one timeout for the challenging team).\nSection III—Reviewable Matters\na. If an instant replay review of a called foul is triggered by a Challenge, the on-court crew \nchief will review the video to evaluate whether the foul being challenged was correctly called.  \nThe on-court crew chief may also review the video to determine only the following other \nmatters:  ",

The on-court crew chief will determine the final outcome when instant replay review \nof a called foul is triggered by a Challenge, with personnel in the Replay Center playing a \nsupporting role.  \nb. The Replay Center Official will determine the final outcome when instant replay \nreview of a called out-of-bounds violation or called goaltending or basket interference violation \nis triggered by a Challenge.  \nEXCEPTION:  For pre-season or regular season games conducted outside an NBA (National Basketball Association) arena, \nthe on-court crew chief will determine the final outcome of any replay review triggered by a \nChallenge.\nc. To overturn a challenged event or to change the outcome of a reviewable matter via a \nChallenge, there must be clear and conclusive visual evidence that the initial adjudication of that \naspect of the play was incorrect.  \nd. Once the instant replay review process is triggered by a Challenge, the on-court crew \nchief or Replay Center Official (as appropriate) shall arrive at one of two determinations with \nrespect to the call that was challenged: \n(1) The call stands (i.e., there is not clear and conclusive visual evidence that the call \nwas incorrect); or \n(2) The call is overturned (i.e., there is clear and conclusive visual evidence that the \ncall was incorrect).   \nSection V—Impact on Timeouts \na. If the call subject to review pursuant to a Challenge is not overturned, the Challenge is \ndeemed unsuccessful and the challenging team loses its timeout.\nb. If the call subject to review pursuant to a Challenge is overturned, the Challenge \nis deemed successful and the challenging team retains its timeout unless the timeout taken in \nconjunction with the Challenge initiated a mandatory timeout.  \nIf a Challenge is utilized to trigger instant replay review of a called foul, that challenge shall \nonly be deemed successful if the called foul is overturned (i.e., not assigned to the player who was \noriginally called for the foul) because the review results in either:     \n(1) No foul assigned to any player (including if the foul was overturned because a \nreviewable violation occurred prior to the foul); or \n(2) A foul assigned to a different player (including a different player on the challenging \nteam).  \nIf a Challenge is utilized to trigger instant replay review of a called foul, that challenge \nshall be deemed unsuccessful if the foul remains assigned to the player originally called for the \nfoul regardless of whether any other reviewable matters are changed to the challenging team’s ",

For the sake of clarity, it shall be deemed an unsuccessful Challenge if a called foul is \nnot overturned but changed from a shooting foul (that would have resulted in free throws for the \nopposing team) to a non-shooting foul (that does not result in free throws for the opposing team).\nc. If a team utilizes a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of an event that immediately \npreceded the challenging team’s mandatory timeout, the challenging team will lose its mandatory \ntimeout (even if the Challenge is successful).  If the Challenge is unsuccessful, the challenging \nteam will only be charged one timeout (i.e., it will not be charged a timeout for both the mandatory \ntimeout and the Challenge).\nd. If a team utilizes a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of an event that preceded \nthe opposing team’s mandatory timeout, the team that is ultimately charged with the timeout \ndepends on whether the Challenge is successful:\n(1) If the Challenge is unsuccessful, the challenging team will be assigned the \ntimeout and, notwithstanding that the Challenge coincided with the opposing team’s \nmandatory timeout, the opposing team will not be charged for the timeout (and, if \nanother mandatory timeout is remaining in the period, the next mandatory timeout will \nbe assigned to the opposing team); and \n(2) If the Challenge is successful, the challenging team will not be assigned a timeout \nand the opposing team will be charged with the timeout.\ne.

If a team attempts to utilize a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of an event when \nthat team has no remaining timeouts, no Challenge will take place, and that team shall be charged \nwith an excessive timeout, for which the penalty is a Technical Foul. \ng. If a team attempts to utilize a Challenge to trigger instant replay of an event that may not \nbe reviewed, the team will be charged a timeout but retain its Challenge.   \nSection VI—Resumption of Play\nIf a Challenge results in the call on the floor being overturned following instant replay \nreview, play is resumed at the point of interruption.  \nFor purposes of this rule only, the point of interruption is where the ball is located when the \nwhistle sounds; provided that:\n(1) If the defensive team utilizes a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of a \ndefensive foul that occurred after an offensive player started his shooting motion on \na successful shot attempt, and the defensive foul itself is overturned after the replay \nreview, the basket shall count (regardless of when the whistle sounded) and the \ndefensive team is awarded the ball to start the next possession; and\n(2) If the offensive team utilizes a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of an out-\nof-bounds violation that occurred simultaneous to a successful shot attempt by the \noffensive player and the whistle sounded after the offensive player started his shooting \nmotion, and the out-of-bounds violation is overturned after replay review, the basket \nshall count and the defensive team is awarded the ball to start the next possession.

    "62": "- 62 -COMMENTS ON THE RULES\nI. GUIDES FOR ADMINISTRA TION AND APPLICA TION OF THE  RULES\nEach official should have a definite and clear conception of their overall responsibilities. \nIt is essential for them to know , understand and implement the rules as intended. If all  officials \npossess the same conception there will be a guaranteed uniformity in the administration of \nall contests.\nThe restrictions placed upon the player by the rules are intended to create a balance \nof play , equal opportunity for the defense and the offense, provide reasonable safety and \nprotection for all players and emphasize cleverness and skill without unduly limiting freedom \nof action of player or team.\nThe purpose of penalties is to compensate a player who has been placed at a disadvantage \nthrough an illegal act of an opponent and to restrain players from committing acts  which, \nif ignored, might lead to roughness even though they do not affect the immediate  play .\nII. BASIC PRINCIPLES\nA. CONTACT SITUATIONS\n1. Incidental Contact\nThe mere fact that contact occurs does not necessarily constitute a foul. Contact which \nis incidental to an effort by a player to play an opponent, reach a loose ball, or perform \nnormal defensive or offensive movements, should not be considered illegal. If, however, a \nplayer attempts to play an opponent from a position where he has no reasonable chance to \nperform without making contact with his opponent, the responsibility is on the player in this \nposition.\nThe hand is considered “part of the ball” when it is in contact with the ball. Therefore, \ncontact on that part of the hand by a defender while it is in contact with the ball is not illegal.\n2. Guarding an Opponent\nIn all guarding situations, a player is entitled to any spot on the court he desires, \nprovided he legally gets to that spot first and without contact with an opponent. If a defensive \nor offensive player has established a position on the floor and his opponent initiates contact \nthat results in the dislodging of the opponent, a foul should be called IMMEDIATELY .\nDuring all throw-ins, the defensive player(s) must be allowed to take a position \nbetween his man and the basket.\nA player may continue to move after gaining a guarding position in the path of an \nopponent provided he is not moving directly or obliquely toward his opponent when contact \noccurs. A player is never permitted to move into the path of an opponent after the opponent \nhas started his upward jumping motion.\nA player who extends a hand, forearm, shoulder, hip or leg into the path of an opponent \nand thereby  causes  contact  is not considered  to have a legal  position  in the path of an \nopponent.\nA player is entitled to a vertical position even to the extent of jumping straight-up or \nholding his arms above his shoulders, as in post play or when double-teaming in pressing  \ntactics.",
    "63": "- 63 -Any player who conforms to the above is absolved from responsibility for any contact  \nby an opponent which may dislodge or tend to dislodge such player from the position which  he \nhas attained and is maintaining legally . If contact occurs, the official must decide whether  the \ncontact is incidental or a foul has been committed.\n3. Screening\nWhen a player screens in front of or at the side of a stationary opponent, he may be as \nclose as he desires providing he does not make contact. His opponent can see him and, there-  \nfore, is expected to detour around the screen.\nIf he screens behind a stationary opponent, the opponent must be able to take a normal  \nstep backward without contact. Because the opponent is not expected to see a screener  \nbehind him, the player screened is given latitude of movement. The defender must be given  an \nopportunity to change direction and avoid contact with the screener.\nT o screen a moving opponent, the player must stop soon enough to permit his opponent  \nthe opportunity to avoid contact. The distance between the player screening and his opponent \nwill depend upon the speed at which the players are moving.\nIf two opponents are moving in the same direction and path, the player who is behind is  \nresponsible for contact. The player in front may stop or slow his pace, but he may not move  \nbackward or sideward into his opponent. The player in front may or may not have the ball.  \nThis situation assumes the two players have been moving in identically the same direction  \nand path before contact.\n4. The Dribble\nIf the dribbler’s path is blocked, he is expected to pass or shoot; that is, he should not  \ntry to dribble by an opponent unless there is a reasonable chance of getting by without contact.\nB. FOULS: FLAGRANT—UNSPORTSMANLIKE\nT o be unsportsmanlike is to act in a manner unbecoming to the image of professional  \nbasketball. It consists of acts of deceit, disrespect of officials and profanity . The penalty for \nsuch action is a technical foul. Repeated acts shall result in expulsion from the game and a  \nminimum fine of $2,000.\nA flagrant foul—penalty (1) is unnecessary contact committed by a player against an  \nopponent.\nA flagrant foul—penalty (2) is unnecessary and excessive contact committed by a  \nplayer against an opponent. It is an unsportsmanlike act and the offender is ejected following  \nconfirmation by instant replay review .\nThe offender will be subject to a fine not exceeding $50,000 and/or suspension by the  \nCommissioner.\nSee Rule 12B—Section IV for interpretation and penalties.\nC. BLOCK-CHARGE\nA defensive player is permitted to establish a legal guarding position in the path of a  \ndribbler regardless of his speed and distance.\nA defensive player is not permitted to move into the path of an offensive player once he  \nhas started his upward motion to attempt a field goal or pass.\nA defensive player must allow a moving player the opportunity to avoid contact when \nthe offensive player receives a pass outside the lower defensive box. The lower defensive box  \nis the area  between the  3-foot posted-up marks,  the bottom tip of the  circle and  the endline.",
    "64": "- 64 -A defensive player must allow an airborne player the opportunity to land and then avoid  \ncontact when the offensive player is outside the lower defensive box.\nA defensive player is permitted to establish a legal guarding position in the path of an  \noffensive player who receives a pass inside the lower defensive box regardless of his speed  \nand distance.\nA defensive player must allow an airborne player who receives a pass the space to land  \nwhen the offensive player is inside the lower defensive box.\nA player must allow a moving opponent without the ball the opportunity to avoid  \ncontact if he moves into his path.\nThe speed of the player will determine the amount of distance an opponent must allow .\nIf an offensive player causes contact with a defensive player who has established a legal  \nposition, an offensive foul shall be called and no points may be scored. A defensive player  \nmay turn slightly to protect himself, but is never allowed to bend over and submarine an  \nopponent.\nAn offensive foul should not be called for charging if the contact is with a secondary  \ndefensive player who has established a defensive position within a designated “restricted  \narea” near the basket for the purpose of drawing an offensive foul. The offensive player must  \ntake a path directly to the rim. The “restricted area” for this purpose is the area bounded by an \narc with a 4-foot radius measured from the center of the basket ring.\nEXCEPTION: Any player may be legally positioned within the “restricted area” if the  \noffensive player receives the ball within the Lower Defensive Box.\nThe mere fact that contact occurs on these type of plays, or any other similar play , does \nnot necessarily mean that a personal foul has been committed. The officials must decide  \nwhether the contact is negligible and/or incidental, judging each situation separately .\nAn offensive foul shall be assessed if the player initiates contact in a non-basketball  \nmanner (leads with his foot, an unnatural extended knee, etc.).\nD. GAME POSTPONEMENT AND CANCELLA TIONS\nThe decision to postpone or cancel a game can only be made by the League Office, after  \nconsultation with the affected teams.\nBefore a game begins, a game may be postponed or cancelled for issues related to the  \ncondition of the playing court or arena, or a general or forecasted condition involving  \nweather, travel, civil unrest, natural disaster, or other event.\nThe following factors will be considered in determining whether a game will be \npostponed or cancelled:\n(1) The whereabouts of teams and game officials (including the efforts that have  \nbeen made or can be made to get these participants to the game site).\n(2) Whether sufficient team and arena staff are available to operate the arena and  \nconduct the game.\n(3) Input from both teams.\n(4) The safety of game participants, team and arena staff, and fans.\n(5) Communications with state or local government officials and law enforcement.\n(6) The ability to reschedule the game.\n(7) Any other factor that the NBA (National Basketball Association) deems relevant to the decision.\nAfter a game has begun, the decision to postpone or cancel that game will be made  \nusing the factors listed above. However, the determination of whether to delay the game  \nwhile the decision is being made is within the authority of the game officials (in consultation  \nwith the League Office).",
    "65": "- 65 -E. PHYSICAL CONT ACT—SUSPENSION\nAny player or coach guilty of intentional physical contact with an official shall \nautomatically be suspended without pay for one game. A fine and/or longer period of suspension \nwill result if circumstances so dictate.\nF. PROTEST\nProtests are not permitted during the course of a game. In order to file a protest, the \nprocedure, as set forth in the NBA (National Basketball Association) constitution, is as follows: “In order to protest against \nor appeal from the result of a game, notice thereof must be given to the Commissioner within  \nforty-eight (48) hours after the conclusion of said game, by e-mail or fax, stating therein the  \ngrounds for such protest. No protest may be filed in connection with any game played during  \nthe regular season after midnight of the day of the last game of the regular schedule. A \nprotest in connection with a playoff game must be filed not later than midnight of the day of \nthe game protested. A game may be protested only by a Governor, Alternate Governor or \nHead Coach. The right of protest shall inure not only to the immediately allegedly aggrieved  \ncontestants, but to any other member who can show an interest in the grounds of protest and  \nthe results that might be attained if the protest were allowed. Each e-mail or fax of protest  \nshall be immediately confirmed by letter and no protest shall be valid unless the letter of \nconfirmation is accompanied by a check in the sum of $10,000 payable to the Association. If \nthe member filing the protest prevails, the $10,000 is to be refunded. If the member does not  \nprevail, the $10,000 is to be forfeited and retained in the Association treasury .\n“Upon receipt of a protest, the Commissioner shall at once notify the member operating  \nthe opposing team in the game protested and require both of said members within five (5) days \nto file with him such evidence as he may desire bearing upon the issue. The Commissioner \nshall decide the question raised within five (5) days after receipt of such evidence.”\nG. SHATTERING BACKBOARDS\nAny player whose contact with the basket ring or backboard causes the backboard to  \nshatter or makes the ring unplayable will be penalized in the following manner:\n(1) Pre-game and/or halftime warm-ups—No penalty to be assessed by officials.\n(2) During  the  game—non-unsportsmanlike conduct technical foul. Under no  \ncircumstances will that player be ejected from the game.\nThe Commissioner will review all actions and plays involved in the shattering of \na backboard.\nH. PLAYER/TEAM CONDUCT AND DRESS\n(1) Each player when introduced, prior to the game, must be uniformly dressed.\n(2) Players, coaches and trainers must stand and line up in a dignified posture along the \nfoul lines during the playing of the American and/or Canadian national anthems.   \n(3) The dress code for players has been modified for the 2020-21 NBA (National Basketball Association) season. Players \nnot in uniform (whether on the Active List or Inactive List) are no longer required \nto wear a sport coat when seated on the bench during games, but such players must \nwear dress attire that is clean and neat in appearance. “Athleisure” (including, but not \nlimited to, jogger pants, jumpsuits, sweatpants, leggings, etc.) or similar attire is not \npermitted when seated on the bench during games.\n(4) While playing, players must keep their uniform shirts tucked into their pants, and  \nno T -shirts are allowed.\n(5) The only article bearing a commercial ‘logo’ which can be worn by players is  \ntheir shoes.",
    "66": "- 66 -I. OFFENSIVE 3-SECONDS\nThe offensive player cannot be allowed in the 3-second lane for more than the allotted  \ntime. This causes the defensive player to ‘hand-check’ because he cannot control the offensive \nplayer for that extended period of time.\nIf the offensive player is in the 3-second lane for less than three seconds and receives  \nthe ball, he must make a move toward the hoop for the official to discontinue his three second \ncount. If he attempts to back the defensive player down, attempting to secure a better  position \nin relation to the basket, offensive three seconds or an offensive foul must be called.  If he passes \noff and immediately makes a move out of the lane, there should be no whistle.\nJ. PLAYER CONDUCT—SPECTATORS\nAny coach, player, trainer, or other team bench person who deliberately enters the \nspectator  stands  during the game will be automatically ejected and the incident reported by \ne-mail to Basketball Operations. Entering the stands to keep a ball in play by a player or the \nmomentum which carries the player into the stands is not considered deliberate. The first row of \nseats is considered the beginning of the stands.\nK. FIGHTING\nViolent acts of any nature on the court will not be tolerated. Players involved in \naltercations will be ejected, fined and/or suspended.\nThere is absolutely no justification for fighting in an NBA (National Basketball Association) game. The fact that you may  \nfeel provoked by another player is not an acceptable excuse. If a player takes it upon himself  to \nretaliate, he can expect to be subject to appropriate penalties.\nL. EXPIRATION OF TIME\nNO LESS THAN :00.3 must expire on the game clock and shot clock when a ball \nis thrown inbounds and then hit instantly out-of-bounds. If less than :00.3 expires in such a \nsituation, the timer will be instructed to deduct A T LEAST :00.3 from the game clock and shot  \nclock. If, in the judgment of the official, the play took longer than :00.3, he will instruct the  \ntimer to deduct more time. If :00.3 or less remain on the game clock when this situation  \noccurs, the period is over. If :00.3 or less remain on the shot clock when this situation  \noccurs, a shot clock violation is called.\nThe game clock and shot clock must show :00.3 or more in order for a player to secure  \npossession of the ball on a rebound or throw-in to attempt a field goal. Instant replay shall be  \nutilized if the basket is successful on this type of play and the game clock runs to 0:00 or the  \nshot clock expires on a made basket and the officials are not reasonably certain that the ball  \nwas released prior to the expiration of the shot clock. The only type of field goal which may  be \nscored if the game clock and shot clock are at :00.2 or :00.1 is a “tip-in” or “high lob.”\nA “tip-in” is defined as any action in which the ball is deflected, not controlled, by a  \nplayer and then enters the basket ring. This type of action shall be deemed legal if :00.1 or \nmore remains in a period.\nA “high lob” is defined as a pass which is tipped by an offensive player while in mid-  \nair, and is followed instantaneously by a field goal attempt. If the reception of the pass and  \nthe subsequent “slam dunk” is immediately adjacent to the basket ring, this type of action  \nshall be deemed legal if :00.1 or more remains in a period. However, if the “high lob”  \nattempt is a distance from the basket ring whereby the ball must be controlled in mid-air, \neither one-handed or two-handed, a minimum of :00.3 is necessary for a field goal to score if \nsuccessful. Instant replay would NOT be used if the play starts with :00.2 or :00.1 on the  \ngame clock or shot clock.",
    "67": "- 67 -NO LESS than :00.3 must expire on the game clock when a player secures possession of \nan unsuccessful free throw attempt and immediately requests a timeout. If LESS than :00.3  \nexpires in such a circumstance, the time on the game clock shall be reduced by at least :00.3.  \nTherefore, if :00.3 OR LESS remain on the game clock when the above situation exists, and  a \nplayer requests a timeout upon securing possession of the ball, the period is over.\nRegardless of when the horn or red light operates to signify the end of period, the \nofficials (as aided by instant replay , if required) will ultimately make the final decision whether  \nto allow or disallow a successful field goal. THE CREW CHIEF MUST T AKE CHARGE \nOF THE SITUA TION.\nM. VERBAL F AN INTERFERENCE\nAny spectator who verbally abuses players and/or coaches in a manner which, in the  \nopinion of the game officials, interferes with the ability of a coach to communicate with his  \nplayers during the game and/or huddles, will, at the direction of the crew chief, be given one  \nwarning by a building security officer. If the same spectator continues to behave in a like  manner, \nthe crew chief shall direct a building security officer to eject the spectator from the  arena.\nN. GUIDELINES FOR INFECTION CONTROL\nIn addition to the Health and Safety Protocols for the 2020-21 NBA (National Basketball Association) Season, any \nsubsequent addition or amendments to the Protocols, or the addition of any other health- or \nsafety-related rules established by the NBA (National Basketball Association) in response to COVID-19 pandemic, all NBA (National Basketball Association) team \nphysicians, athletic trainers, equipment managers, and related personnel must comply with the \ninfection control procedures set forth below (in this Section N) in all NBA (National Basketball Association) arenas, locker rooms, \ntraining rooms, and practice facilities.  \nIf a player suffers a laceration or a wound where bleeding occurs or if blood is visible  on \na player or his uniform, the officials shall suspend the game at the earliest appropriate  time and \nallow a maximum of 30 seconds for treatment. After that time, the head coach shall  be informed \nthat he has the option to substitute for the player or call a timeout. If a substitute replaces the \nplayer, the opposing team shall be allowed to  substitute one player. The bleeding player may \nreturn to the game when he has received  appropriate treatment by medical staff personnel.\nA team will not be given an additional 30 seconds should the bleeding occur from a  \nwound which reopened, which is not the result of additional contact.\nIf the player returns to the game, the officials shall make certain that any lesion, wound \nor dermatitis is covered with a dressing that will prevent contamination to and/or from other  \nsources. A wrist or sweat band is not considered a suitable bandage.\nIf the bleeding player is awarded a free throw attempt(s) as a result of a personal foul,  \nor is involved in a jump ball, the bleeding player will be given 30 seconds for treatment. \nIf the treatment is not completed, play will resume and will then be suspended at the first  \nappropriate time.\nMandatory timeouts shall not be granted during a suspension of play unless a team is \ngranted a timeout. \nIf treatment is not completed within the allotted time, the head coach may call another  \ntimeout or substitute for the bleeding player. Substitutes are permitted consistent with existing \nrules on substitution.\nIf a team has no timeouts remaining when play is suspended, the officials will allow 30 \nseconds for appropriate treatment. If the treatment is not completed in accordance with para-  \ngraph two above, the bleeding player must be removed immediately. ONL Y the bleeding  \nplayer on that team may be removed from the game under these circumstances. If so, the  \nopponent may also substitute one player.\nThe offensive team will receive a full eight seconds to advance the ball into the front- \ncourt. The shot clock will remain as is or reset to 14, whichever is greater.",
    "68": "- 68 -O. DEAD BALL, LIVE BALL, BALL IS ALIVE\nAfter the ball has been dead, it is put into play by a jump ball, throw-in or a free throw \nattempt. The game clock does not start until the ball is legally touched on the court by a  \nplayer. However, any floor violation or personal foul which may occur will be penalized.\nThe ball is live when it is given to the thrower-in, free throw shooter or is tossed by the  \nofficial on a jump ball. Illegal contact, which occurs prior to the ball becoming live, will be  \nignored if it is not unsportsmanlike or flagrant.\nThe ball is alive when it is legally tapped by one of the participants of a jump ball,  \nreleased by a thrower-in or released on a free throw attempt that will remain in play .\nP. TAUNTING\nIf a player blatantly taunts an opponent, a technical foul shall be assessed. The \nopponent  WILL NOT , automatically , be assessed a technical foul. His behavior will be the \ndetermining factor.\nSimultaneous taunting is a verbal altercation. V erbal altercations and unsportsmanlike  \nconduct will be administered as a double technical foul and no free throws will be attempted.\nT echnical fouls assessed to opposing teams during the same dead ball and prior to the  \nadministering of any free throw attempt for the first technical foul, shall be interpreted as a  \ndouble technical foul.\nA PLAYER(S) GUILTY OF TAUNTING MUST BE SINGLED OUT AND PENALIZED.\nIf a previous unsportsmanlike act has been committed and if this situation is BLA T ANT , \na technical foul must be assessed and the guilty player(s) must be ejected.\nQ. FLAGRANT FOUL CRITERIA\n1. The severity of the contact;\n2. Whether or not the player was making a legitimate basketball play (e.g., whether  \na player is making a legitimate effort to block a shot; note, however, that a foul  \ncommitted during a block attempt can still be considered flagrant if other criteria  are \npresent, such as recklessness and hard contact to the head);\n3. Whether, on a foul committed with a player’s arm or hand, the fouling player  \nwound up and/or followed through after making contact;\n4. The potential for injury resulting from contact (e.g., a blow to the head and a  \nfoul committed while a player is in a vulnerable position);\n5. The severity of any injury suffered by the offended player; and\n6. The outcome of the contact (e.g., whether it led to an altercation).",

Description of Organization  \n \nThe Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fa me, Inc. (“Hall of Fame”) is a not-for-profit \norganization formed under Internal Revenue Code Secti on 501(c)(3).  It operates as a memorial to the \noriginator of basketball and includes a Hall of  Fame to honor basketball greats, a museum, and a \nlibrary in Springfie ld, Massachusetts. \n Its wholly-owned for profit subsidiary, Springfi eld Riverfront Development Corporation (“SRDC”), \nwas incorporated to develop and manage the re tail/entertainment complex on the Springfield \nRiverfront.  Operations began in October 2002.  The complex is inte nded to enhance the museum and \nattract additi onal visitors. \n \n \n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n \nBasis of Presentation \n \nThe accompanying financial statements, which are presented on the accrual basis of accounting, have \nbeen prepared to focus on the Hall of Fame as a whole and to present ba lances and transactions \naccording to the existence or absence of donor-impos ed restrictions.  Accordingly, net assets and \nchanges therein are classified as follows: \n \nNet assets without donor restriction \nNet assets that are not restricted by donors or th e donor-imposed restricti ons have expired.  Net \nassets without donor restrictions may be designated for specific purposes by action of the Board \nof Trustees.  Revenues are reported as increases in net assets without donor restrictions unless \nuse of the related assets is limited by donor-imposed restricti ons.  Expenses are reported as \ndecreases in net assets without donor restrictions .  Gains and losses on i nvestments are reported \nas increases or decreases in net assets without donor  restrictions unless thei r use is restricted by \nexplicit donor stipul ations or law. \n \nNet assets with donor restriction \nRepresent net assets which are subject to donor-im posed restrictions whose use is restricted by \ntime and/or purpose.  A portion of  the Hall of Fame’s net asse ts with donor restrictions are \nsubject to donor-imposed restrictio ns that require the Hall of Fame to use or expend the gifts as \nspecified, based on purpose or passage of time.  When donor restrictions e xpire, that is, when a \npurpose restriction is fulf illed or a time restriction ends, such net assets are reclassified to net \nassets without donor restri ctions and reported on th e statement of activities as net assets released \nfrom restrictions.    Another portion of net assets with  donor restrictions stipulates that the corpus of the gifts be \nmaintained in perpetuity.  Genera lly, the donors of these assets pe rmit the Hall of Fame to use \nall or part of the income ear ned on related investments for general or specific purposes. \n  ",
    "84": "NAISMITH MEMORIAL BASKETBALL HALL OF FAME, INC.  \n(PARENT COMPANY ONLY) \n \nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued \n_______ \n  \n10 Revenue Recognition \n \nThe Hall of Fame generally measur es revenue based on the amount of consideration the Hall of Fame \nexpects to be entitled for the transfer of goods or se rvices to a customer, then  recognizes this revenue \nwhen or as the Hall of Fame satisfies its pe rformance obligations under a contract, except in \ntransactions where U.S. GAAP provi des other applicable guidance. Th e Hall of Fame evaluates its \nrevenue contracts with customers (i.e. earned revenue) based on th e five-step model under Topic 606: \n(1) identify the contract with the customer; (2) iden tify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) \ndetermine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to separate performance obligations; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) each  performance obligation is satisfied. \n \nEarned revenue is recognized as services/events are provided. Other income is recognized as it is \nearned. \n \nGains and losses on investments are reported as incr eases or decreases to net assets without donor \nrestrictions unless their use is re stricted by donor-imposed stipulati on or state law. As of December \n31, 2021 and 2020, there were no restrict ions on investment income. \n \nContributions and Sponsorships \n \nContributions and sponsorships that are restricted by the donor are reported as increases in net assets \nwithout donor restrictio ns if the restrictions expire  (that is, when a stipulated  time restriction ends or \npurpose restriction is accomplished) in the repor ting period in which the revenue is recognized. \nContributions of property and equipm ent are reported as net assets wi th donor restrictions if the donor \nrestricted the use of the property or equipment to a particular program, as ar e contributions of cash \nrestricted to the purchase of prope rty and equipment. Otherwise, donor restrictions on contributions of \nproperty and equipment or assets restricted for pur chase of property and equi pment are considered to \nexpire when the assets are placed in service. A ll other donor-restricted cont ributions are reported as \nincreases in net assets with donor restrictions. When a restriction expires, net assets with donor \nrestrictions are reclassifi ed to net assets without donor restrictions and repor ted in the Statement of \nActivities as net assets released from restrictions.  \nPromises to Give \n \nConditional promises to give are not recognized in the financial st atements until th e conditions are \nsubstantially met or explicitly waived by the donor. Unconditional promises to give that are expected \nto be collected within one year ar e recorded at net realizable valu e. Unconditional promises to give \nthat are expected to be collected in  more than one year are recorded at  fair value, which is measured as \nthe present value of thei r future cash flows. The discounts on t hose amounts are computed using risk-\nadjusted interest rates applicable to the years in which the promises are rece ived.  Amortization of the \ndiscounts is included in c ontribution revenue. In the absence of donor stipulations to the contrary, \npromises with payments due in  future periods are restricted  to use after the due date. \n \n \n ",

A team may utilize a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of only the following \nthree events: (1) a called personal foul charged to its own team, (2) a called out-of-bounds \nviolation, or (3) a called goaltending or basket interference violation; provided that, in the last \ntwo minutes of the fourth period and last two minutes of any overtime, a team is no longer \nable to utilize a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of a called goaltending or basket \ninterference violation, as review of these events during these periods will be exclusively \ntriggered\tby\tthe\ton-court\tgame\tofficials. \t\nNOTE: A Coach’s Challenge is the only mechanism to trigger replay review of out-of-\nbounds violations at any point during the game.\nd.

To initiate a Challenge, the challenging team must take the following steps in sequence:\n(1) The challenging team must call a legal timeout immediately after the call in \nquestion (unless a mandatory timeout or timeout called by the opposing team is \nalready underway);\n(2)  The challenging team’s head coach must simultaneously signal for a Challenge \nby\tutilizing\tthe\tinstant\treplay\tsignal\t(i.e.,\ttwirling\tan\tindex\tfinger)\ttoward\tthe\tgame\t\nofficial(s)\t during\tthe\tsame\tinteraction\t with\tthe\tgame\tofficial(s)\t in\twhich\tthe\ttimeout\t\nwas called or, if the timeout was called by a player on the challenging team, the \nchallenging team’s head coach must simultaneously signal for the Challenge by \nutilizing\t the\tinstant\treplay\tsignal\ttoward\tthe\tgame\tofficials\tas\tthe\tgame\tofficial\tis\t\nnotifying the scorekeeper of the timeout; and\n(3) During\tthe\tsame\tinteraction\t with\tthe\tgame\tofficial(s)\t in\twhich\tthe\tchallenging \t\nteam’s head coach signaled for the Challenge, the challenging team’s head coach must \nnotify\tthe\tgame\tofficial(s)\tof\tthe\tspecific\tevent\tthat\tthe\tteam\tis\tchallenging.\nFor\tpurposes\t of\tthis\trule\tonly,\t“immediately”\t shall\tmean\tthat\ta\ttimeout\tis\tcalled\tprior\tto\t\nthe ball being given to the thrower-in, the ball being given to the free throw shooter, or \nthe ball being tossed on a jump ball, whichever is applicable (unless a mandatory timeout \nor timeout called by the opposing team is already underway).  \nb. To initiate a Challenge of an event that immediately preceded a mandatory timeout or \ntimeout called by the opposing team, no later than 30 seconds from the start of the timeout (as \nmeasured by the timeout clock), the challenging team’s head coach must take the following steps \nin sequence:  \n(1) Signal for a Challenge by utilizing the instant replay signal toward the game \nofficials;\tand \t\n(2) During\tthe\tsame\tinteraction\t with\tthe\tgame\tofficial(s)\t in\twhich\tthe\tchallenging \t\nteam’s head coach signaled for the Challenge, the challenging team’s head coach must \nnotify\tthe\tgame\tofficial(s)\tof\tthe\tspecific\tevent\tthat\tthe\tteam\tis\tchallenging.",

Guarding an Opponent\nIn all guarding situations, a player is entitled to any spot on the court he desires, \nprovided\t he\tlegally\tgets\tto\tthat\tspot\tfirst\tand\twithout\tcontact\twith\tan\topponent.\t If\ta\tdefensive \t\nor\toffensive\t player\thas\testablished\t a\tposition\ton\tthe\tfloor\tand\this\topponent\t initiates\tcontact\t\nthat results in the dislodging of the opponent, a foul should be called IMMEDIATELY .\nDuring all throw-ins, the defensive player(s) must be allowed to take a position \nbetween his man and the basket.\nA player may continue to move after gaining a guarding position in the path of an \nopponent provided he is not moving directly or obliquely toward his opponent when contact \noccurs. A player is never permitted to move into the path of an opponent after the opponent \nhas started his upward jumping motion.\nA player who extends a hand, forearm, shoulder, hip or leg into the path of an opponent \nand thereby  causes  contact  is not considered  to have a legal  position  in the path of an \nopponent.\nA player is entitled to a vertical position even to the extent of jumping straight-up or \nholding his arms above his shoulders, as in post play or when double-teaming in pressing  \ntactics.",

Screening\nWhen a player screens in front of or at the side of a stationary opponent, he may be as \nclose as he desires providing he does not make contact. His opponent can see him and, there-  \nfore, is expected to detour around the screen.\nIf he screens behind a stationary opponent, the opponent must be able to take a normal  \nstep backward without contact. Because the opponent is not expected to see a screener  \nbehind him, the player screened is given latitude of movement. The defender must be given  an \nopportunity to change direction and avoid contact with the screener.\nT o screen a moving opponent, the player must stop soon enough to permit his opponent  \nthe opportunity to avoid contact. The distance between the player screening and his opponent \nwill depend upon the speed at which the players are moving.\nIf two opponents are moving in the same direction and path, the player who is behind is  \nresponsible for contact. The player in front may stop or slow his pace, but he may not move  \nbackward or sideward into his opponent. The player in front may or may not have the ball.  \nThis situation assumes the two players have been moving in identically the same direction  \nand path before contact.\n4. The Dribble\nIf the dribbler’s path is blocked, he is expected to pass or shoot; that is, he should not  \ntry to dribble by an opponent unless there is a reasonable chance of getting by without contact.\nB.

The \nthird official will monitor the benches.\nb. Replay reviews should be conducted within two minutes. Notwithstanding this \ngeneral rule, discretion will be used to extend the review period as reasonably necessary under  \nunusual circumstances, such as when the play could lead to an ejection (e.g., flagrant  fouls/\npenalty 2), technical issues arise with the replay system, the outcome of the replay  review \nrequires multiple replay review angles, or additional angles are imminent.

Instant replay review triggered pursuant to this rule shall be \nreferred to as a “Coach’s Challenge” (or “Challenge” for short).\nb. Each team is entitled to one Challenge per game. If a team’s first Challenge is \nsuccessful, the team will be awarded a second Challenge. \nc. A team may utilize a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of only the following \nthree events: (1) a called personal foul charged to its own team, (2) a called out-of-bounds \nviolation, or (3) a called goaltending or basket interference violation; provided that, in the last \ntwo minutes of the fourth period and last two minutes of any overtime, a team is no longer \nable to utilize a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of a called goaltending or basket \ninterference violation, as review of these events during these periods will be exclusively \ntriggered by the on-court game officials. \nNOTE: A Coach’s Challenge is the only mechanism to trigger replay review of out-of-\nbounds violations at any point during the game.\nd. Any called foul, violation, or other decision by the game officials not listed in Section \nI(c) above, or any non-call, is not a challengeable event. For clarity, instant replay review of the \nfollowing events, among others, may not be triggered by a Challenge: (1) a called personal foul \ncharged to the opposing team, (2) continuation—e.g., whether a defensive foul occurred prior to \nthe offensive player beginning his shooting motion, (3) a Technical Foul or Flagrant Foul, and \n(4) violations such as traveling, carrying, double dribble, flopping, or an offensive or defensive \nthree-seconds. As set forth in Section III(a)(3) below, any aspect related to continuation \nconstitutes a reviewable matter when a called foul is properly challenged, but continuation is \nnot by itself an independent challengeable event.\nSection II—Procedure to Initiate the Challenge\na. To initiate a Challenge, the challenging team must take the following steps in sequence:\n(1) The challenging team must call a legal timeout immediately after the call in \nquestion (unless a mandatory timeout or timeout called by the opposing team is \nalready underway);\n(2)  The challenging team’s head coach must simultaneously signal for a Challenge \nby utilizing the instant replay signal (i.e., twirling an index finger) toward the game \nofficial(s) during the same interaction with the game official(s) in which the timeout \nwas called or, if the timeout was called by a player on the challenging team, the \nchallenging team’s head coach must simultaneously signal for the Challenge by \nutilizing the instant replay signal toward the game officials as the game official is \nnotifying the scorekeeper of the timeout; and\n(3) During the same interaction with the game official(s) in which the challenging \nteam’s head coach signaled for the Challenge, the challenging team’s head coach must \nnotify the game official(s) of the specific event that the team is challenging.\nFor purposes of this rule only, “immediately” shall mean that a timeout is called prior to \nthe ball being given to the thrower-in, the ball being given to the free throw shooter, or \nthe ball being tossed on a jump ball, whichever is applicable (unless a mandatory timeout \nor timeout called by the opposing team is already underway).  \nb. To initiate a Challenge of an event that immediately preceded a mandatory timeout or \ntimeout called by the opposing team, no later than 30 seconds from the start of the timeout (as \nmeasured by the timeout clock), the challenging team’s head coach must take the following steps \nin sequence:  ",

In the event the game officials conference to determine the call on the floor (and, as a \nresult, the final ruling on the play is unknown for a period of time), the window of time within \nwhich a team must immediately challenge the call starts after the officials notify the negatively \naffected team of the final ruling on the play. The negatively affected team’s window to challenge \nthe final ruling on the play ends when the ball is given to the inbounder or free throw shooter, \njump-ball is tossed, or 30 seconds after the team has been notified of the final ruling on the play in \nthe event that a mandatory timeout or timeout by the opposing team has been called (whichever \nis applicable).\nd. A team loses its opportunity to challenge the prior call if it is called for a delay-of-game \nafter the call in question but prior to calling timeout and simultaneously signaling for a Challenge.\ne. Once instant replay review is triggered by a valid Challenge, the official will notify \nthe official scorer of the Challenge. The official scorer shall immediately record the Challenge \nand, once the instant replay review process is complete, the outcome of the Challenge (including \nwhether the Challenge resulted in a loss of one timeout for the challenging team).\nSection III—Reviewable Matters\na.

If the Challenge is unsuccessful, the challenging \nteam will only be charged one timeout (i.e., it will not be charged a timeout for both the mandatory \ntimeout and the Challenge).\nd. If a team utilizes its first Challenge to trigger instant replay review of an event that \npreceded the opposing team’s mandatory timeout, the team that is ultimately charged with the \ntimeout depends on whether the Challenge is successful:\n(1) If the Challenge is unsuccessful, the challenging team will be assigned the \ntimeout and, notwithstanding that the Challenge coincided with the opposing team’s \nmandatory timeout, the opposing team will not be charged for the timeout (and, if \nanother mandatory timeout is remaining in the period, the next mandatory timeout will \nbe assigned to the opposing team); and \n(2) If the Challenge is successful, the challenging team will not be assigned a timeout \nand the opposing team will be charged with the timeout.\nIf a team utilizes its second Challenge to trigger instant replay review of an event that \npreceded the opposing team’s mandatory timeout, the challenging team will be assigned the \ntimeout (even if the Challenge is successful).",

If all  officials \npossess the same conception, there will be a guaranteed uniformity in the administration of \nall contests.\nThe restrictions placed upon the player by the rules are intended to create a balance \nof play , equal opportunity for the defense and the offense, provide reasonable safety and \nprotection for all players and emphasize cleverness and skill without unduly limiting freedom \nof action of player or team.\nThe purpose of penalties is to compensate a player who has been placed at a disadvantage \nthrough an illegal act of an opponent and to restrain players from committing acts  which, \nif ignored, might lead to roughness even though they do not affect the immediate  play .\nII. BASIC PRINCIPLES\nA. CONTACT SITUATIONS\n1. Incidental Contact\nThe mere fact that contact occurs does not necessarily constitute a foul. Contact which \nis incidental to an effort by a player to play an opponent, reach a loose ball, or perform \nnormal defensive or offensive movements, should not be considered illegal. If, however, a \nplayer attempts to play an opponent from a position where he has no reasonable chance to \nperform without making contact with his opponent, the responsibility is on the player in this \nposition.\nThe hand is considered “part of the ball” when it is in contact with the ball. Therefore, \ncontact on that part of the hand by a defender while it is in contact with the ball is not illegal.\n2. Guarding an Opponent\nIn all guarding situations, a player is entitled to any spot on the court he desires, \nprovided he legally gets to that spot first and without contact with an opponent. If a defensive \nor offensive player has established a position on the floor and his opponent initiates contact \nthat results in the dislodging of the opponent, a foul should be called IMMEDIATELY .\nDuring all throw-ins, the defensive player(s) must be allowed to take a position \nbetween his man and the basket.\nA player may continue to move after gaining a guarding position in the path of an \nopponent provided he is not moving directly or obliquely toward his opponent when contact \noccurs. A player is never permitted to move into the path of an opponent after the opponent \nhas started his upward jumping motion.\nA player who extends a hand, forearm, shoulder, hip or leg into the path of an opponent \nand thereby  causes  contact  is not considered  to have a legal  position  in the path of an \nopponent.\nA player is entitled to a vertical position even to the extent of jumping straight-up or \nholding his arms above his shoulders, as in post play or when double-teaming in pressing  \ntactics.",
    "247": "- 66 -Any player who conforms to the above is absolved from responsibility for any contact  \nby an opponent which may dislodge or tend to dislodge such player from the position which  he \nhas attained and is maintaining legally . If contact occurs, the official must decide whether  the \ncontact is incidental or a foul has been committed.\n3. Screening\nWhen a player screens in front of or at the side of a stationary opponent, he may be as \nclose as he desires providing he does not make contact. His opponent can see him and, there-  \nfore, is expected to detour around the screen.\nIf he screens behind a stationary opponent, the opponent must be able to take a normal  \nstep backward without contact. Because the opponent is not expected to see a screener  \nbehind him, the player screened is given latitude of movement. The defender must be given  an \nopportunity to change direction and avoid contact with the screener.\nT o screen a moving opponent, the player must stop soon enough to permit his opponent  \nthe opportunity to avoid contact. The distance between the player screening and his opponent \nwill depend upon the speed at which the players are moving.\nIf two opponents are moving in the same direction and path, the player who is behind is  \nresponsible for contact. The player in front may stop or slow his pace, but he may not move  \nbackward or sideward into his opponent. The player in front may or may not have the ball.  \nThis situation assumes the two players have been moving in identically the same direction  \nand path before contact.\n4. The Dribble\nIf the dribbler’s path is blocked, he is expected to pass or shoot; that is, he should not  \ntry to dribble by an opponent unless there is a reasonable chance of getting by without contact.\nB. FOULS: FLAGRANT—UNSPORTSMANLIKE\nT o be unsportsmanlike is to act in a manner unbecoming to the image of professional  \nbasketball. It consists of acts of deceit, disrespect of officials and profanity . The penalty for \nsuch action is a technical foul. Repeated acts shall result in expulsion from the game and a  \nminimum fine of $2,000.\nA flagrant foul—penalty (1) is unnecessary contact committed by a player against an  \nopponent.\nA flagrant foul—penalty (2) is unnecessary and excessive contact committed by a  \nplayer against an opponent. It is an unsportsmanlike act and the offender is ejected following  \nconfirmation by instant replay review .\nThe offender will be subject to a fine not exceeding $100,000 and/or suspension by \nthe Commissioner.\nSee Rule 12B, Section IV for interpretation and penalties.\nC. BLOCK-CHARGE\nA defensive player is permitted to establish a legal guarding position in the path of a  \ndribbler regardless of his speed and distance.\nA defensive player is not permitted to move into the path of an offensive player once he  \nhas started his upward motion to attempt a field goal or pass.\nA defensive player must allow a moving player the opportunity to avoid contact when \nthe offensive player receives a pass outside the lower defensive box. The lower defensive box  \nis the area  between the  3-foot posted-up marks,  the bottom tip of the  circle and  the endline.",
    "248": "- 67 -A defensive player must allow an airborne player the opportunity to land and then avoid  \ncontact when the offensive player is outside the lower defensive box.\nA defensive player is permitted to establish a legal guarding position in the path of an  \noffensive player who receives a pass inside the lower defensive box regardless of his speed  \nand distance.\nA defensive player must allow an airborne player who receives a pass the space to land  \nwhen the offensive player is inside the lower defensive box.\nA player must allow a moving opponent without the ball the opportunity to avoid  \ncontact if he moves into his path.\nThe speed of the player will determine the amount of distance an opponent must allow .\nIf an offensive player causes contact with a defensive player who has established a legal  \nposition, an offensive foul shall be called and no points may be scored. A defensive player  \nmay turn slightly to protect himself, but is never allowed to bend over and submarine an  \nopponent.\nAn offensive foul should not be called for charging if the contact is with a secondary  \ndefensive player who has established a defensive position within a designated “restricted  \narea” near the basket for the purpose of drawing an offensive foul. The offensive player must  \ntake a path directly to the rim. The “restricted area” for this purpose is the area bounded by an \narc with a 4-foot radius measured from the center of the basket ring.\nEXCEPTION: Any player may be legally positioned within the “restricted area” if the  \noffensive player receives the ball within the Lower Defensive Box.\nThe mere fact that contact occurs on these type of plays, or any other similar play , does \nnot necessarily mean that a personal foul has been committed. The officials must decide  \nwhether the contact is negligible and/or incidental, judging each situation separately .\nAn offensive foul shall be assessed if the player initiates contact in a non-basketball  \nmanner (leads with his foot, an unnatural extended knee, etc.).\nD. GAME POSTPONEMENT AND CANCELLA TIONS\nWhether made before a game begins or after a game has begun, the decision to postpone or \ncancel a game can only be made by the League Office, after consultation with the affected teams.\nThe NBA (National Basketball Association) may postpone or cancel a game before the game begins or after the game has \nbegun for issues related to the condition of the playing court or arena, or a general or forecasted \ncondition involving weather, travel, civil unrest, natural disaster, public and/or player and staff \nhealth and safety, or another unusual situation.\nThe factors that the NBA (National Basketball Association) may consider in determining whether to postpone or cancel a \ngame include:\n(1) The whereabouts of teams and game officials (including the efforts that have been \nmade or can be made to get these participants to the game site).\n(2) Whether sufficient team and arena staff are available to operate the arena and \nconduct the game.\n(3) Input from both teams.\n(4) The health, safety, and well-being of game participants, team and arena staff, \nand fans.\n(5) Input from health, facilities, security, or other experts, when appropriate.\n(6) Input from players involved.\n(7) Communications with and/or mandates by state or local government officials and \nlaw enforcement.",
    "249": "- 68 -(8) The ability to reschedule the game, including with consideration for impact to the \nleague-wide schedule, competitive fairness, and league and team business opportunities.\n(9) Any other factor that the NBA (National Basketball Association) deems relevant to the decision.\nIn the event of a situation that arises after a game has begun, the game officials have the \nauthority to decide whether to temporarily delay the game while the decision to postpone or \ncancel is being made by the NBA (National Basketball Association).\nE. PHYSICAL CONT ACT—SUSPENSION\nAny player or coach guilty of intentional physical contact with an official shall \nautomatically be suspended without pay for one game. A fine and/or longer period of suspension \nwill result if circumstances so dictate.\nF. PROTEST\nProtests are not permitted during the course of a game. In order to file a protest, the \nprocedure, as set forth in the NBA (National Basketball Association) Constitution, is as follows: “In order to protest against or \nappeal from the result of a game, notice thereof must be given to the Commissioner within forty-\neight (48) hours after the conclusion of said game, by a Writing, stating therein the grounds for \nsuch protest. No protest may be filed in connection with any game played during the Regular \nSeason after midnight of the day of the last game of the regular schedule, or, for a game played \non the last day of the Regular Season, more than ten (10) hours following the game’s conclusion. \nA protest in connection with a playoff game must be filed not later than ten (10) hours following \nthe game’s conclusion. A game may be protest may only be filed by a Governor, Alternate \nGovernor, General Manager, or Head Coach. The right of protest shall inure not only to the \nimmediately allegedly aggrieved contestants, but to any other Member who can show an interest \nin the grounds of protest and the results that might be attained if the protest were allowed. No \nprotest shall be valid unless the Written Notice to the Commissioner thereof is accompanied by \na payment in the sum of $25,000 (the “Protest Fee”) payable to the Association. If the Member \nfiling the protest prevails, the Protest Fee is to be refunded. If the Member does not prevail, the \nProtest Fee is to be forfeited and retained in the Association treasury.\n“Upon receipt of a protest, the Commissioner shall at once notify the Member operating \nthe opposing team in the game protested and require both of said members within five (5) days \nto file with him such evidence as he may desire bearing upon the issue. The Commissioner shall \ndecide the question raised within five (5) days after such evidence is due.  Notwithstanding the \nforegoing, for a protest in connection with a Playoff Game or any other situation where greater \nexpedition is required, the filing of evidence by Members and the Commissioner’s decision of \nthe question raised each shall occur on a schedule as determined by the Commissioner.”\nG. SHATTERING BACKBOARDS\nAny player whose contact with the basket ring or backboard causes the backboard to  \nshatter or makes the ring unplayable will be penalized in the following manner:\n(1) Pre-game and/or halftime warm-ups—No penalty to be assessed by officials.\n(2) During  the  game—non-unsportsmanlike conduct technical foul. Under no  \ncircumstances will that player be ejected from the game.\nThe Commissioner will review all actions and plays involved in the shattering of \na backboard.\nH. PLAYER/TEAM CONDUCT AND DRESS\n(1) Each player when introduced, prior to the game, must be uniformly dressed.\n(2) Players, coaches and trainers must stand and line up in a dignified posture along the \nfoul lines during the playing of the American and/or Canadian national anthems.   ",
    "250": "- 69 -(3) Players not in uniform (whether on the Active List or Inactive List) must wear dress \nattire that is clean and neat in appearance (e.g., league approved team-issued apparel). \n“Athleisure” (including, but not limited to, jogger pants, jumpsuits, sweatpants, etc.) \nor similar attire is not permitted when seated on the bench during games (except that, \nas previously noted, league approved team-issued apparel is permissible).\n(4) While playing, players must keep their uniform shirts tucked into their pants, and  \nno T -shirts are allowed.\n(5) The only article bearing a commercial ‘logo’ which can be worn by players is  \ntheir shoes.\nI. OFFENSIVE THREE-SECONDS\nThe offensive player cannot be allowed in the three-second lane for more than the \nallotted  time. This causes the defensive player to ‘hand-check’ because he cannot control the \noffensive player for that extended period of time.\nIf the offensive player is in the three-second lane for less than three seconds and \nreceives  the ball, he must make a move toward the hoop for the official to discontinue his three \nsecond count. If he attempts to back the defensive player down, attempting to secure a better  \nposition in relation to the basket, offensive three seconds or an offensive foul must be called.  If \nhe passes off and immediately makes a move out of the lane, there should be no whistle.\nJ. PLAYER CONDUCT—SPECTATORS\nAny coach, player, trainer, or other team bench person who deliberately enters the \nspectator stands during the game will be automatically ejected and the incident reported by \ne-mail to Basketball Operations. Entering the stands to keep a ball in play by a player or the \nmomentum which carries the player into the stands is not considered deliberate. The first row of \nseats is considered the beginning of the stands.\nK. FIGHTING\nViolent acts of any nature on the court will not be tolerated. Players involved in \naltercations will be ejected, fined and/or suspended.\nThere is absolutely no justification for fighting in an NBA (National Basketball Association) game. The fact that a player \nmay feel provoked by another person is not an acceptable excuse. If a player takes it upon \nhimself to retaliate, he can expect to be subject to appropriate penalties.\nL. EXPIRATION OF TIME\nNO LESS THAN :00.3 must expire on the game clock and shot clock when a ball \nis thrown inbounds and then hit instantly out-of-bounds. If less than :00.3 expires in such a \nsituation, the timer will be instructed to deduct A T LEAST :00.3 from the game clock and shot  \nclock. If, in the judgment of the official, the play took longer than :00.3, he/she will instruct \nthe timer to deduct more time. If :00.3 or less remain on the game clock when this situation  \noccurs, the period is over. If :00.3 or less remain on the shot clock when this situation  \noccurs, a shot clock violation is called.\nThe game clock and shot clock must show :00.3 or more in order for a player to secure  \npossession of the ball on a rebound or throw-in to attempt a field goal. Instant replay shall be  \nutilized if the basket is successful on this type of play and the game clock runs to 0:00 or the  \nshot clock expires on a made basket and the officials are not reasonably certain that the ball  \nwas released prior to the expiration of the shot clock. The only type of field goal which may  be \nscored if the game clock and shot clock are at :00.2 or :00.1 is a “tip-in” or “high lob.”\nA “tip-in” is defined as any action in which the ball is deflected, not controlled, by a  \nplayer and then enters the basket ring. This type of action shall be deemed legal if :00.1 or \nmore remains in a period.",
    "251": "- 70 -A “high lob” is defined as a pass which is tipped by an offensive player while in mid-  \nair, and is followed instantaneously by a field goal attempt. If the reception of the pass and  the \nsubsequent “slam dunk” is immediately adjacent to the basket ring, this type of action  shall \nbe deemed legal if :00.1 or more remains in a period. However, if the “high lob”  attempt \nis a distance from the basket ring whereby the ball must be controlled in mid-air, either one-\nhanded or two-handed, a minimum of :00.3 is necessary for a field goal to score if successful. \nInstant replay would NOT be used if the play starts with :00.2 or :00.1 on the  game \nclock or shot clock.NO LESS than :00.3 must expire on the game clock when a player secures \npossession of an unsuccessful free throw attempt and immediately requests a timeout. If LESS \nthan :00.3  expires in such a circumstance, the time on the game clock shall be reduced by at \nleast :00.3.  Therefore, if :00.3 OR LESS remain on the game clock when the above situation \nexists, and  a player requests a timeout upon securing possession of the ball, the period is over.\nRegardless of when the horn or red light operates to signify the end of period, the \nofficials (as aided by instant replay , if required) will ultimately make the final decision whether  \nto allow or disallow a successful field goal. THE CREW CHIEF MUST T AKE CHARGE \nOF THE SITUA TION.\nM. VERBAL F AN INTERFERENCE\nAny spectator who verbally abuses players and/or coaches in a manner which, in the  \nopinion of the game officials, interferes with the ability of a coach to communicate with his  \nplayers during the game and/or huddles, will, at the direction of the crew chief, be given one  \nwarning by a building security officer. If the same spectator continues to behave in a like  manner, \nthe crew chief shall direct a building security officer to eject the spectator from the  arena.\nN. GUIDELINES FOR INFECTION CONTROL\nIn addition to any health- or safety-related rules established by the NBA (National Basketball Association), all NBA (National Basketball Association) team \nphysicians, athletic trainers, equipment managers, and related personnel must comply with the \ninfection control procedures set forth below (in this Section N) in all NBA (National Basketball Association) arenas, locker rooms, \ntraining rooms, and practice facilities. \nIf a player suffers a laceration or a wound where bleeding occurs or if blood is visible  on \na player or his uniform, the officials shall suspend the game at the earliest appropriate  time and \nallow a maximum of 30 seconds for treatment. After that time, the head coach shall  be informed \nthat he has the option to substitute for the player or call a timeout. If a substitute replaces the \nplayer, the opposing team shall be allowed to  substitute one player. The bleeding player may \nreturn to the game when he has received  appropriate treatment by medical staff personnel.\nA team will not be given an additional 30 seconds should the bleeding occur from a  \nwound which reopened, which is not the result of additional contact.\nIf the player returns to the game, the officials shall make certain that any lesion, wound \nor dermatitis is covered with a dressing that will prevent contamination to and/or from other  \nsources. A wrist or sweat band is not considered a suitable bandage.\nIf the bleeding player is awarded a free throw attempt(s) as a result of a personal foul,  \nor is involved in a jump ball, the bleeding player will be given 30 seconds for treatment. \nIf the treatment is not completed, play will resume and will then be suspended at the first  \nappropriate time.\nMandatory timeouts shall not be granted during a suspension of play unless a team is \ngranted a timeout. \nIf treatment is not completed within the allotted time, the head coach may call another  \ntimeout or substitute for the bleeding player. Substitutes are permitted consistent with existing \nrules on substitution.",
    "252": "- 71 -If a team has no timeouts remaining when play is suspended, the officials will allow 30 \nseconds for appropriate treatment. If the treatment is not completed in accordance with para-  \ngraph two above, the bleeding player must be removed immediately. ONL Y the bleeding  \nplayer on that team may be removed from the game under these circumstances. If so, the  \nopponent may also substitute one player.\nThe offensive team will receive a full eight seconds to advance the ball into the front- \ncourt. The shot clock will remain as is or reset to 14, whichever is greater.\nO. DEAD BALL, LIVE BALL, BALL IS ALIVE\nAfter the ball has been dead, it is put into play by a jump ball, throw-in or a free throw \nattempt. The game clock does not start until the ball is legally touched on the court by a  \nplayer. However, any floor violation or personal foul which may occur will be penalized.\nThe ball is live when it is given to the thrower-in, free throw shooter or is tossed by the  \nofficial on a jump ball. Illegal contact, which occurs prior to the ball becoming live, will be  \nignored if it is not unsportsmanlike or flagrant.\nThe ball is alive when it is legally tapped by one of the participants of a jump ball,  \nreleased by a thrower-in or released on a free throw attempt that will remain in play .\nP. TAUNTING\nIf a player blatantly taunts an opponent, a technical foul shall be assessed. The \nopponent  WILL NOT , automatically , be assessed a technical foul. His behavior will be the \ndetermining factor.\nSimultaneous taunting is a verbal altercation. V erbal altercations and unsportsmanlike  \nconduct will be administered as a double technical foul and no free throws will be attempted.\nT echnical fouls assessed to opposing teams during the same dead ball and prior to the  \nadministering of any free throw attempt for the first technical foul, shall be interpreted as a  \ndouble technical foul.\nA PLAYER(S) GUILTY OF TAUNTING MUST BE SINGLED OUT AND PENALIZED.\nIf a previous unsportsmanlike act has been committed and if this situation is BLA T ANT , \na technical foul must be assessed and the guilty player(s) must be ejected.\nQ. FLAGRANT FOUL CRITERIA\n1. The severity of the contact;\n2. Whether or not the player was making a legitimate basketball play (e.g., whether  \na player is making a legitimate effort to block a shot; note, however, that a foul  \ncommitted during a block attempt can still be considered flagrant if other criteria  are \npresent, such as recklessness and hard contact to the head);\n3. Whether, on a foul committed with a player’s arm or hand, the fouling player  \nwound up and/or followed through after making contact;\n4. The potential for injury resulting from contact (e.g., a blow to the head and a  \nfoul committed while a player is in a vulnerable position);\n5. The severity of any injury suffered by the offended player; and\n6. The outcome of the contact (e.g., whether it led to an altercation).",
