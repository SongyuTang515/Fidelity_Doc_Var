    "62": "- 62 -COMMENTS ON THE RULES\nI. GUIDES FOR ADMINISTRA TION AND APPLICA TION OF THE  RULES\nEACH OFFICIAL SHOULD HAVE A DEFINITE AND CLEAR CONCEPTION OF THEIR OVERALL RESPONSIBILITIES. \nIT IS ESSENTIAL FOR THEM TO KNOW , UNDERSTAND AND IMPLEMENT THE RULES AS INTENDED. IF ALL  OFFICIALS \nPOSSESS THE SAME CONCEPTION THERE WILL BE A GUARANTEED UNIFORMITY IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF \nALL CONTESTS.\nTHE RESTRICTIONS PLACED UPON THE PLAYER BY THE RULES ARE INTENDED TO CREATE A BALANCE \nOF PLAY , EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR THE DEFENSE AND THE OFFENSE, PROVIDE REASONABLE SAFETY AND \nPROTECTION FOR ALL PLAYERS AND EMPHASIZE CLEVERNESS AND SKILL WITHOUT UNDULY LIMITING FREEDOM \nOF ACTION OF PLAYER OR TEAM.\nTHE PURPOSE OF PENALTIES IS TO COMPENSATE A PLAYER WHO HAS BEEN PLACED AT A DISADVANTAGE \nTHROUGH AN ILLEGAL ACT OF AN OPPONENT AND TO RESTRAIN PLAYERS FROM COMMITTING ACTS  WHICH, \nIF IGNORED, MIGHT LEAD TO ROUGHNESS EVEN THOUGH THEY DO NOT AFFECT THE IMMEDIATE  PLAY .\nII. BASIC PRINCIPLES\nA. CONTACT SITUATIONS\n1. INCIDENTAL CONTACT\nTHE MERE FACT THAT CONTACT ORCURS DOES NOT NECESSARILY CONSTITUTE A FOUL. CONTACT WHICH \nIS INCIDENTAL TO AN EFFORT BY A PLAYER TO PLAY AN OPPONENT, REACH A LOOSE BALL, OR PERFORM \nNORMAL DEFENSIVE OR OFFENSIVE MOVEMENTS, SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED ILLEGAL. IF, HOWEVER, A \nPLAYER ATTEMPTS TO PLAY AN OPPONENT FROM A POSITIOZ WHERE HE HAS NO REASONABLE CHANCE TO \nPERFORM WITHOUT MAKING CONTACT WITH HIS OPPONENT, THE RESPONSIBILITY IS ON THE PLAYER IN THIS \nPOSITION.\nTHE HAND IS CONSIDERED “PART OF THE BALL” WHEN IT IS IN CONTACT WITH THE BALL. THEREFORE, \nCONTACT ON THAT PART OF THE HAND BY A DEFENDER WHILE IT IS IN CONTACT WITH THE BALL IS NOT ILLEGAL.\n2. GUARDING AN OPPONENT\nIN ALL GUARDING SITUATIONS, A PLAYER IS ENTITLED TO ANY SPOT ON THE COURT HE DESIRES, \nPROVIDED HE LEGALLY GETS TO THAT SPOT FIRST AND WITHOUT CONTACT WITH AN OPPONENT. IF A DEFENSIVE \nOR OFFENSIVE PLAYER HAS ESTABLISHED A POSITION ON THE FLOOR AND HIS OPPONENT INITIATES CONTACT \nTHAT RESULTS IN THE DISLODGING OF THE OPPONENT, A FOUL SHOULD BE CALLED IMMEDIATELY .\nDURING ALL THROW-INS, THE DEFENSIVE PLAYER(S) MUST BE ALLOWED TO TAKE A POSITION \nBETWEEN HIS MAN AND THE BASKET.\nA PLAYER MAY CONTINUE TO MOVE AFTER GAINING A GUARDING POSITION IN THE PATH OF AN \nOPPONENT PROVIDED HE IS NOT MOVING DIRECTLY OR OBLIQUELY TOWARD HIS OPPONCNT WHEN CONTACT \nOCCURS. A PLAYER IS NEVER PERMITTED TO MOVE INTO THE PATH OF AN OPPONENT AFTER THE OPPONENT \nHAS STARTED HIS UPWARD JUMPING MOTION.\nA PLAYER WHO EXTENDS A HAND, FOREARM, SHOULDER, HIP OR LEG INTO THE PATH OF AN OPPONENT \nAND THEREBY  CAUSES  CONTACT  IS NOT CONSIDERED  TO HAVE A LEGAL  POSITION  IN THE PATH OF AN \nOPPONENT.\nA PLAYER IS ENTITLED TO A VERTICAL POSITION EVEN TO THE EXTENT OF JUMPING STRAIGHT-UP OR \nHOLDING HIS ARMS ABOVE HIS SHOULDERS, AS IN POST PLAY OR WHEN DOUBLE-TEAMING IN PRESSING  \nTACTICS.",
    "63": "- 63 -ANY PLAYER WHO CONFORMS TO THE ABOVE IS ABSOLVED FROM RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY CONTACT  \nBY AN OPPONENT WHICH MAY DISLODGE OR TEND TO DISLODGE SUCH PLAYER FROM THE POSITION WHICH  HE \nHAS ATTAINED AND IS MAINTAINING LEGALLY . IF CONTACT OCCURS, THE OFFICIAL MUST DECIDE WHETHER  THE \nCONTACT IS INCIDENTAL OR A FOUL HAS BEEN COMMITTED.\n3. SCREENING\nWHEN A PLAYER SCREENS IN FRONT OF OR AT THE SIDE OF A STATIONARY OPPONENT, HE MAY BE AS \nCLOSE AS HE DESIRES PROVIDING HE DOES NOT MAKE CONTACT. HIS OPPONENT CAN SEE HIM AND, THERE-  \nFORE, IS EXPECTED TO DETOUR AROUND THE SCREEN.\nIF HE SCREENS BEHIND A STATIONARY OPPONENT, THE OPPONENT MUST BE ABLE TO TAKE A NORMAL  \nSTEP BACKWARD WITHOUT CONTACT. BECAUSE THE OPPONENT IS NOT EXPECTED TO SEE A SCREENER  \nBEHIND HIM, THE PLAYER SCREENED IS GIVEN LATITUDE OF MOVEMENT. THE DEFENDER MUST BE GIVEN  AN \nOPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE DIRECTION AND AVOID CONTACT WITH THE SCREENER.\nT O SCREEN A MOVING OPPONENT, THE PLAYER MUST STOP SOON ENOUGH TO PERMIT HIS OPPONENT  \nTHE OPPORTUNITY TO AVOID CONTACT. THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE PLAYER SCREENING AND HIS OPPONENT \nWILL DEPEND UPON THE SPEED AT WHICH THE PLAYERS ARE MOVING.\nIF TWO OPPONENTS ARE MOVING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND PATH, THE PLAYER WHO IS BEHIND IS  \nRESPONSIBLE FOR CONTACT. THE PLAYER IN FRONT MAY STOP OR SLOW HIS PACE, BUT HE MAY NOT MOVE  \nBACKWARD OR SIDEWARD INTO HIS OPPONENT. THE PLAYER IN FRONT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE THE BALL.  \nTHIS SITUATION ASSUMES THE TWO PLAYERS HAVE BEEN MOVING IN IDENTICALLY THE SAME DIRECTION  \nAND PATH BEFORE CONTACT.\n4. THE DRIBBLE\nIF THE DRIBBLER’S PATH IS BLOCKED, HE IS EXPECTED TO PASS OR SHOOT; THAT IS, HE SHOULD NOT  \nTRY TO DRIBBLE BY AN OPPONENT UNLESS THERE IS A REASONABLE CHANCE OF GETTING BY WITHOUT CONTACT.\nB. FOULS: FLAGRANT—UNSPORTSMANLIKE\nT O BE UNSPORTSMANLIKE IS TO ACT IN A MANNER UNBECOMING TO THE IMAGE OF PROFESSIONAL  \nBASKETBALL. IT CONSISTS OF ACTS OF DECEIT, DISRESPECT OF OFFICIALS AND PROFANITY . THE PENALTY FOR \nSUCH ACTION IS A TECHNICAL FOUL. REPEATED ACTS SHALL RESULT IN EXPULSION FROM THE GAME AND A  \nMINIMUM FINE OF $2,000.\nA FLAGRANT FOUL—PENALTY (1) IS UNNECESSARY CONTACT COMMITTED BY A PLAYER AGAINST AN  \nOPPONENT.\nA FLAGRANT FOUL—PENALTY (2) IS UNNECESSARY AND EXCESSIVE CONTACT COMMITTED BY A  \nPLAYER AGAINST AN OPPONENT. IT IS AN UNSPORTSMANLIKE ACT AND THE OFFENDER IS EJECTED FOLLOWING  \nCONFIRMATION BY INSTANT REPLAY REVIEW .\nTHE OFFENDER WILL BE SUBJECT TO A FINE NOT EXCEEDING $50,000 AND/OR SUSPENSION BY THE  \nCOMMISSIONER.\nSEE RULE 12B—SECTION IV FOR INTERPRETATION AND PENALTIES.\nC. BLOCK-CHARGE\nA DEFENSIVE PLAYER IS PERMITTED TO ESTABLISH A LEGAL GUARDING POSITION IN THE PATH OF A  \nDRIBBLER REGARDLESS OF HIS SPEED AND DISTANCE.\nA DEFENSIVE PLAYER IS NOT PERMITTED TO MOVE INTO THE PATH OF AN OFFENSIVE PLAYER ONCE HE  \nHAS STARTED HIS UPWARD MOTION TO ATTEMPT A FIELD GOAL OR PASS.\nA DEFENSIVE PLAYER MUST ALLOW A MOVING PLAYER THE OPPORTUNITY TO AVOID CONTACT WHEN \nTHE OFFENSIVE PLAYER RECEIVES A PASS OUTSIDE THE LOWER DEFENSIVE BOX.

    "246": "- 65 -COMMENTS ON THE RULES\nI. GUIDES FOR ADMINISTRA TION AND APPLICA TION OF THE  RULES\nEACH OFFICIAL SHOULD HAVE A DEFINITE AND CLEAR CONCEPTION OF THEIR OVERALL RESPONSIBILITIES. \nIT IS ESSENTIAL FOR THEM TO KNOW , UNDERSTAND AND IMPLEMENT THE RULES AS INTENDED. IF ALL  OFFICIALS \nPOSSESS THE SAME CONCEPTION, THERE WILL BE A GUARANTEED UNIFORMITY IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF \nALL CONTESTS.\nTHE RESTRICTIONS PLACED UPON THE PLAYER BY THE RULES ARE INTENDED TO CREATE A BALANCE \nOF PLAY , EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR THE DEFENSE AND THE OFFENSE, PROVIDE REASONABLE SAFETY AND \nPROTECTION FOR ALL PLAYERS AND EMPHASIZE CLEVERNESS AND SKILL WITHOUT UNDULY LIMITING FREEDOM \nOF ACTION OF PLAYER OR TEAM.\nTHE PURPOSE OF PENALTIES IS TO COMPENSATE A PLAYER WHO HAS BEEN PLACED AT A DISADVANTAGE \nTHROUGH AN ILLEGAL ACT OF AN OPPONENT AND TO RESTRAIN PLAYERS FROM COMMITTING ACTS  WHICH, \nIF IGNORED, MIGHT LEAD TO ROUGHNESS EVEN THOUGH THEY DO NOT AFFECT THE IMMEDIATE  PLAY .\nII. BASIC PRINCIPLES\nA. CONTACT SITUATIONS\n1. INCIDENTAL CONTACT\nTHE MERE FACT THAT CONTACT OCCURS DOES NOT NECESSARILY CONSTITUTE A FOUL. CONTACT WHICH \nIS INCIDENTAL TO AN EFFORT BY A PLAYER TO PLAY AN OPPONENT, REACH A LOOSE BALL, OR PERFORM \nNORMAL DEFENSIVE OR OFFENSIVE MOVEMENTS, SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED ILLEGAL. IF, HOWEVER, A \nPLAYER ATTEMPTS TO PLAY AN OPPONENT FROM A POSITION WHERE HE HAS NO REASONABLE CHANCE TO \nPERFORM WITHOUT MAKING CONTACT WITH HIS OPPONENT, THE RESPONSIBILITY IS ON THE PLAYER IN THIS \nPOSITION.\nTHE HAND IS CONSIDERED “PART OF THE BALL” WHEN IT IS IN CONTACT WITH THE BALL. THEREFORE, \nCONTACT ON THAT PART OF THE HAND BY A DEFENDER WHILE IT IS IN CONTACT WITH THE BALL IS NOT ILLEGAL.\n2. GUARDING AN OPPONENT\nIN ALL GUARDING SITUATIONS, A PLAYER IS ENTITLED TO ANY SPOT ON THE COURT HE DESIRES, \nPROVIDED HE LEGALLY GETS TO THAT SPOT FIRST AND WITHOUT CONTACT WITH AN OPPONENT. IF A DEFENSIVE \nOR OFFENSIVE PLAYER HAS ESTABLISHED A POSITION ON THE FLOOR AND HIS OPPONENT INITIATES CONTACT \nTHAT RESULTS IN THE DISLODGING OF THE OPPONENT, A FOUL SHOULD BE CALLED IMMEDIATELY .\nDURING ALL THROW-INS, THE DEFENSIVE PLAYER(S) MUST BE ALLOWED TO TAKE A POSITION \nBETWEEN HIS MAN AND THE BASKET.\nA PLAYER MAY CONTINUE TO MOVE AFTER GAINING A GUARDING POSITION IN THE PATH OF AN \nOPPONENT PROVIDED HE IS NOT MOVING DIRECTLY OR OBLIQUELY TOWARD HIS OPPONENT WHEN CONTACT \nOCCURS. A PLAYER IS NEVER PERMITTED TO MOVE INTO THE PATH OF AN OPPONENT AFTER THE OPPONENT \nHAS STARTED HIS UPWARD JUMPING MOTION.\nA PLAYER WHO EXTENDS A HAND, FOREARM, SHOULDER, HIP OR LEG INTO THE PATH OF AN OPPONENT \nAND THEREBY  CAUSES  CONTACT  IS NOT CONSIDERED  TO HAVE A LEGAL  POSITION  IN THE PATH OF AN \nOPPONENT.\nA PLAYER IS ENTITLED TO A VERTICAL POSITION EVEN GO THE EXTENT OF JUMPING STRAIGHT-UP OR \nHOLDING HIS ARMS ABOVE HIS SHOULDERS, AS IN POST PLAY OR WHEN DOUBLE-TEAMING IN PRESSING  \nTACTICS.",
    "247": "- 66 -ANY PLAYER WHO CONFORMS TO THE ABOVE IS ABSOLVED FROM RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY CONTACT  \nBY AN OPPONENT WHICH MAY DISLODGE OR TEND TO DISLODGE SUCH PLAYER FROM THE POSITION WHICH  HE \nHAS ATTAINED AND IS MAINTAINING LEGALLY . IF CONTACT OCCURS, THE OFFICIAL MUST DECIDE WHETHER  THE \nCONTACT IS INCIDENTAL OR A FOUL HAS BEEN COMMITTED.\n3. SCREENING\nWHEN A PLAYER SCREENS IN FRONT OF OR AT THE SIDE OF A STATIONARY OPPONENT, HE MAY BE AS \nCLOSE AS HE DESIRES PROVIDING HE DOES NOT MAKE CONTACT. HIS OPPONENT CAN SEE HIM AND, THERE-  \nFORE, IS EXPECTED TO DETOUR AROUND THE SCREEN.\nIF HE SCREENS BEHIND A STATIONARY OPPONENT, THE OPPONENT MUST BE ABLE TO TAKE A NORMAL  \nSTEP BACKWARD WITHOUT CONTACT. BECAUSE THE OPPONENT IS NOT EXPECTED TO SEE A SCREENER  \nBEHIND HIM, THE PLAYER SCREENED IS GIVEN LATITUDE OF MOVEMENT. THE DEFENDER MUST BE GIVEN  AN \nOPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE DIRECTION AND AVOID CONTACT WITH THE SCREENER.\nT O SCREEN A MOVING OPPONENT, THE PLAYER MUST STOP SOON ENOUGH TO PERMIT HIS OPPONENT  \nTHE OPPORTUNITY TO AVOID CONTACT. THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE PLAYER SCREENING AND HIS OPPONENT \nWILL DEPEND UPON THE SPEED AT WHICH THE PLAYERS ARE MOVING.\nIF TWO OPPONENTS ARE MOVING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND PATH, THE PLAYER WHO IS BEHIND IS  \nRESPONSIBLE FOR CONTACT. THE PLAYER IN FRONT MAY STOP OR SLOW HIS PACE, BUT HE MAY NOT MOVE  \nBACKWARD OR SIDEWARD INTO HIS OPPONENT. THE PLAYER IN FRONT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE THE BALL.  \nTHIS SITUATION ASSUMES THE TWO PLAYERS HAVE BEEN MOVING IN IDENTICALLY THE SAME DIRECTION  \nAND PATH BEFORE CONTACT.\n4. THE DRIBBLE\nIF THE DRIBBLER’S PATH IS BLOCKED, HE IS EXPECTED TO PASS OR SHOOT; THAT IS, HE SHOULD NOT  \nTRY TO DRIBBLE BY AN OPPONENT UNLESS THERE IS A REASONABLE CHANCE OF GETTING BY WITHOUT CONTACT.\nB. FOULS: FLAGRANT—UNSPORTSMANLIKE\nT O BE UNSPORTSMANLIKE IS TO ACT IN A MANNER UNBECOMING TO THE IMAGE OF PROFESSIONAL  \nBASKETBALL. IT CONSISTS OF ACTS OF DECEIT, DISRESPECT OF OFFICIALS AND PROFANITY . THE PENALTY FOR \nSUCH ACTION IS A TECHNICAL FOUL. REPEATED ACTS SHALL RESULT IN EXPULSION FROM THE GAME AND A  \nMINIMUM FINE OF $2,000.\nA FLAGRANT FOUL—PENALTY (1) IS UNNECESSARY CONTACT COMMITTED BY A PLAYER AGAINST AN  \nOPPONENT.\nA FLAGRANT FOUL—PENALTY (2) IS UNNECESSARY AND EXCESSIVE CONTACT COMMITTED BY A  \nPLAYER AGAINST AN OPPONENT.
